To run the Instagram chatbot on AWS, you can use the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service, which allows you to easily deploy, manage, and scale applications in the AWS cloud. Follow these steps to deploy the chatbot on AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

Create an AWS account: If you don't have an AWS account, sign up for one at https://aws.amazon.com/.

Install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI): The EB CLI is a command-line tool that helps you deploy
and manage your application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html.

Package the application: Compress the entire Instagram chatbot project, including the app.py, config.txt, requirements.txt, and other files into a single ZIP file. 
You can do this using a file compression tool or by running the following command in your terminal:

bash

zip -r instagram_chatbot.zip .

Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment:
Open the Elastic Beanstalk Console in the AWS Management Console. Click on "Create a new environment," choose "Web server environment," and click "Select."

Configure the environment:

For "Platform," choose "Python."
For "Application code," choose "Upload your code" and upload the instagram_chatbot.zip file that you created earlier.
You can leave other settings at their default values.
Click on "Create environment" to start the creation process. AWS will provision resources and deploy your application.

Configure environment variables: Once the environment is up and running, you need to add your Instagram username and password as environment variables.
In the Elastic Beanstalk console, click on the name of your environment. 
Then, under the "Configuration" tab, click on the "Edit" button next to "Software." Here, you can add environment variables:

username with the value of your Instagram username
password with the value of your Instagram password

Click "Apply" to save your changes.

Deploy the updated application: 
In the Elastic Beanstalk console, click on the name of your environment, and under the "Upload and deploy" button, 
click on "Choose file" to select the updated instagram_chatbot.zip file. Click "Deploy" to update the application.

Your Instagram chatbot is now running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk! The chatbot will periodically check for new unread
messages in your Instagram direct messages and respond accordingly.


HOW TO SET ENVIROMENTAL VARIABLES:

For Windows:

Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables."
Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
In the "System Properties" window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
In the "Environment Variables" window, under "User variables," click on the "New" button.
Enter the variable name and value, and click "OK." For example, you can set variable name INSTAGRAM_USERNAME and value as your Instagram username.
For macOS and Linux:

Open a terminal.

If you want to set the environment variable temporarily (only for the current session), use the export command:

arduino
export INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
If you want to set the environment variable permanently, add the export command to your shell's configuration file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, or .zshrc, depending on your shell):

bash
echo 'export INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username' >> ~/.bashrc
Replace ~/.bashrc with the appropriate configuration file for your shell if necessary.

Restart your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc (or the appropriate configuration file) to apply the changes.

After setting the environment variables, you can access them in your Python script using the os.environ dictionary:

python
Copy code
import os

instagram_username = os.environ["INSTAGRAM_USERNAME"]
Remember to replace your_username with your actual Instagram username.
